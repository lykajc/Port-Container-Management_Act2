# Port-Container-Management_Act2
A console-based Port Container Management System that simulates real-world container and ship handling at a shipping port. Containers are managed using a stack (LIFO), while ships are managed using a queue (FIFO). The system allows storing containers, registering ships, viewing the current port state, and loading containers onto ships.
